How to run the webapp:

For this project we used xampp(wamp) therefore you must have xampp installed on your machine.

Start the apache server and mysql from xampp 

To generate the database we have provided a sql script called "435proj.sql". Once the xampp server and mysql is running type localhost
type localhost into your browser and hit enter.

You should be at the xampp dashboard and from there you will click on phpmyadmin

Once there create a new database called "435proj"

Once the database is created click on the database then click import 

There will be a choose file button. This is where you will upload the "435proj.sql" file

Once it is uploaded scroll down and hit GO

This will successfully create all the necessary tables for he webapp 

Now that the database is ready you must put the "photos-viewer" folder into xampp's htdocs folder 

You are ready to use the webapp , head to localhost/photos-viewer and proceed to use the webapp
